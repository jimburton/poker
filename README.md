## Stages of Texas Hold 'Em

+ **Buy in**

	Each player pays the same fixed cost to join the game.
	
+ **Rounds**

  A game consists of a number of rounds. At the beginning of the first
  round the *dealer button* is assigned to one of the players. In each
  successive round the dealer button is passed to the left.
  
  The player immediately to the left of the dealer button is the *small
  blind*, and the player to the left of the small blind is the *big
  blind*.
  
  The first player to act in each betting round is the player to the
  left of the big blind.
